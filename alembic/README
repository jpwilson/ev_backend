# EeveeCars.com Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for EeveeCars.com, the all-inclusive platform for electric vehicle (EV) data. This FastAPI-based service works in tandem with our React frontend to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Overview

The EeveeCars backend is engineered to facilitate access to a wealth of EV data, ranging from detailed specifications to user-generated reviews.

## Features

- **EV Data Management**: Robust CRUD operations for managing electric vehicle data.
- **API Endpoints**: Well-defined endpoints for interacting with the EV database.
- **Data Validation**: Leverages Pydantic for robust data validation.

## Technologies

- **FastAPI**: For building high-performance API endpoints.
- **SQLAlchemy**: As the ORM of choice for database interactions.
- **SQLite**: For a lightweight, file-based database solution (will change to postgres once app is validated)
- **Pydantic**: For data validation using Python type annotations.
